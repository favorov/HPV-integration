Start point: gzipped FASTQs from paired-end sequencing.

1) Map to human genome 
# e.map_pe_fastq_gz2genome.cl.pl --fasta ... --fastq-01 ... --fastq-02 ... --out your_prefix

You get a BAM file (let's say, original.bam) with all reads, mapped and unmapped to human genome

2) Find viruses

# samtools view -bh -f 4 original.bam > only_unmapped_reads.bam

# my_script_for_bam_input only_unmapped_reads.bam

You get ...ex.so file with results

3) Find possible integrations. Let's say, on the previous step we found presence of HPV16. 

- Get HPV16 genome in FASTA format. NCBI database, choose Nucleotide database,  type hpv16 complete genome. Then choose the link with the Accession: NC_001526.2. 
Send -> file (fasta) -> save
Then index this genome with bwa.

# bwa index -a is hpv16.fasta

- Now you extract two types of reads from the original.bam.
a) One unmapped end, whose mate is mapped to human genome
# samtools view -bh -f 4 -F 264 original.bam > 1hg19.2um.bam
#-f include all
#-F excluse (any?)
# 264=octal 108
#0x4 segment unmapped
#0x8 next segment in the template unmapped
#0x100 secondary alignment


b) One mapped to human genome end, whose mate is unmapped 
# samtools view -bh -f 8 -F 260 original.bam > 1um.2hg19mp.bam
# 260=octal 104
#0x4 segment unmapped
#0x8 next segment in the template unmapped
#0x100 secondary alignment

- Map unmapped ends to HPV16 genome
# e.map_se_bam2genome.cl.pl --fasta hpv16.fasta --bam 1hg19.2um.bam --out your_prefix

Result: File prefix.bam that contsins ends mapped to HPV16.

- Now we want to extract corresponding ends, that were mapped to human genome

# samtools view prefix.bam | cut -f1 > reads.ids

# extract.out -R reads.ids 1um.2hg19mp.bam > 1mphpv16.2mphg19.sam

Result: 1mphpv16.2mphg19.sam that contains human ends of chimeric human-viral discordant read pairs. Look for the regions that have at least 2 or 3 reads.
